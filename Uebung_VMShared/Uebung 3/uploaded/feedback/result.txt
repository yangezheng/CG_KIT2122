Wrapping:
All tests of this exercise passed.

EvaluateBilinear:
test "BilinearInside-Range01" failed: Computed texture sample does not match reference solution
test "BilinearAtBorder" failed: Computed texture sample does not match reference solution. Did you use truncation (for example cast to int) instead of floor?
test "BilinearPositiveUV" failed: Computed texture sample does not match reference solution. Did you use truncation (for example cast to int) instead of floor?

MipMapping:
test "CreateMipmap square" failed: Miplevel 1 does not match reference solution
test "CreateMipmap non-square" failed: Wrong number of miplevels for image of size (1024, 512): got 10, expected 11
test "ComputeUVAABBSize" failed: Image comparison using the following settings failed:
Scene:               textured_sphere
RenderMode:          DUDV
Texture filter mode: TRILINEAR
Normal mapping:      disabled

Image comparison using the following settings failed:
Scene:               aliasing_plane
RenderMode:          DUDV
Texture filter mode: TRILINEAR
Normal mapping:      disabled

test "EvaluateTrilinear" failed: Computed texture sample does not match reference solution

RayTransform:
test "TransformDirectionAndPosition" failed: result of transform_position does not match reference solution
test "LocalIntersectionTests" failed: Image comparison using the following settings failed:
Scene:               go_board
RenderMode:          NORMAL
Texture filter mode: 
Normal mapping:      disabled

test "TransformDirToObjSpace" failed: Transformed coordinate space is incorrect
