instead of using evaluate_phone_BRDF(), i added a method evaluate_gooch_BRDF.
Basically it adds a unrealistic effect on the existing phong model: imaging
the lights have warm color, so all the sides that are facing to the lights will
have warm color blending into its color rendering. And the sides that are not
facing the lights, will have a cold color blending into its rendering. I achieve
this effect by following the formular from the paper: Amy Gooch, Bruce Gooch, Peter Shirley, 
Elaine Cohen. A Non-Photorealistic Lighting Model For Automatic Technical 
Illustration. Department of Computer Science University of Utah.
